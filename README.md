# 🎨 SketchDDD - Simplifying Domain Modeling for Everyone

## 💡 Description
SketchDDD is a visual and textual toolkit for Domain-Driven Design. It helps users build accurate domain models with easy drag-and-drop features for domain experts, or a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for developers. This tool validates aggregates, context maps, and business rules while also generating code. Whether you are a business expert or a budding developer, SketchDDD makes modeling easier and more intuitive.
